  <h3>What is Java?</h3>  
  <div>  
    <p>  
   Java is a simple, object oriented, concurrent and general purpose programming language.   
  Some other important features of java are robust, secure, portable, interactive and high performance.   
  Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 since then it has become very popular due to its feature  
   like platform independent and robust in the case of memory management.  
    </p>    
  </div>  
  <h3>Why is it called platform?</h3>  
  <div>  
    <p>  
   Because java has its own run time environment (JRE) and API so it is called platform.  
    </p>  
  </div>  
  <h3>Where is it used?</h3>  
  <div>
