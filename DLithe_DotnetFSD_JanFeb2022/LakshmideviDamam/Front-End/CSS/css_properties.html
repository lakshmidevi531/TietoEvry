    <h1>CSS Styling Properties</h1>
    <!---CSS Overflow-->
    <h2>CSS Overflow</h2>
    <pre>
        The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.
        
        The overflow property has the following values:
        
        visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
        hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
        scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
        auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
        </pre>
        <p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:</p>

<div>VISIBLE:You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div><hr><br><br><br<br><br><br><br>
<div class="one">HIDDEN:You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
<hr>
<br>
<div class="two">SCROLL:You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
<hr>
<br>
<div class="three">AUTO:You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
<br><br>

<h1>Image Transparency</h1>
<p>The opacity property is often used together with the :hover selector to change the opacity on mouse-over:</p>
<img src="Bg_01.jpg" alt="background" width="170" height="100">
<img src="Bg_01.jpg" alt="background" width="170" height="100">
<img src="css_img.jpg" alt="background" width="170" height="100" style="opacity: 0.4;">
<h1>Transparent Box</h1>
<p>When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements become transparent as well. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read:</p>

<div class="first"><p>opacity 0.2</p></div><br>
<div class="second"><p>opacity 0.4</p></div><br>
<div class="third"><p>opacity 0.6</p></div><br>
<div><p>opacity 1 (default)</p></div><hr>
<br><h1>CSS Float</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:left">Float Right</h2>
    <p>In this example, the image will float to the right in the paragraph, and the text in the paragraph will wrap around the image.</p>
    
    <p><img class="one" src="Bg_01.jpg" alt="background" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
    The float Property
    The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.
    
    The float property can have one of the following values:
    
    left - The element floats to the left of its container
    right - The element floats to the right of its container
    none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
    In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.<p>
    <hr><br>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Float Left</h2><br>
    
    <p>In this example, the image will float to the right in the paragraph, and the text in the paragraph will wrap around the image.</p>
    
    <p><img class="two" src="Bg_01.jpg" alt="background" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">

    <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
    <pre style="color:red;font-size:20px">

        The CSS Box Model
        In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
        
        The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
        
        It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
        
        Explanation of the different parts:
        
        Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
        Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
        Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
        Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
        
        </pre>
